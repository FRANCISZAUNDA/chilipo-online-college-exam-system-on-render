# chilipo_online_exam_system-

task 3 adds the webs frontend

it uses javascript and css libralies from

bootstrap
Owl Carousel
lightbox
slick slider
isotopes

many of the libralies have been implemenyted on the main page only


the flow of the program is 

a default Admin is created when the program is first run
for security reason accounts for admins and lectures are made by other registered admins
it would not make sense that everyone should just register as an admin or lecture on his own

THe Admin will create Departments First and Assign courses to each Department;
registered lectures will then assign exams to their courses;
they will form questions and assign them to an exam;
